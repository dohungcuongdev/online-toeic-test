All employees who have been working for the\r\ncompany two years or less will receive one week (five working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who\r\nhave been working here three to five years will receive two weeks (ten working days) of paid vacation per year.\r\nEmployees who have been with the company five to ten years will receive three weeks (15 working days) of\r\npaid vacation per year. Employees who have been here more than 10 years will receive four weeks (20 working\r\ndays) of paid vacation per year.\r\nPlease note that this does not effect current policies for sick days and personal leave. All employees, regardless\r\nof experience, will still receive five days of paid sick leave per year, as well as two days of paid personal leave.\r\nPlease post the new vacation policy in your departments as soon as possible. Also, employee handbooks are\r\nbeing revised to reflect the changes in vacation policy. These handbooks should be ready within the next two\r\nweeks. When they are, you are responsible to distribute them to employees, and to send us verification that\r\neach employee has received the handbook and understands the new vacation policy.\r\nThank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Thank you for your usual prompt shipment. We appreciate the\r\nfast turn-around.\r\nUnfortunately, I noticed a couple of discrepancies between the freight and the invoice. First, the\r\ndiscount for the white photocopier paper does not seem to be factored into the total. We have been\r\nbuying this paper from you at $100 a case, so shouldn't six cases with a 10-percent discount come to\r\n$540?\r\nSecond, according to my records we had 10 crates of computer chairs on back order. Are more coming?\r\nIf so, what's the soonest you expect they could arrive? Also, could you please give me an idea when\r\nmore color ink cartridges will be available? Our inventory is low, and we are planning to have a special\r\nsale for Halloween.\r\nCould you please get back to me ASAP? I need to clarify these questions before I place our October\r\norder. If you prefer to call, it's best to reach me today on my direct line: 556-424-8737.\r\nThanks again Marc,\r\nIda Velasquiz\r\nComptroller, Office Corral",

A History of Sports from Ancient Times to the Present covers everything\r\nfrom sporting events in ancient Rome to the origins of teams sports in North America, and it includes a\r\nsection on sports played on contemporary university campuses. I highly recommend the chapter with\r\ndetailed instructions on how to play games that had previously been lost over time. Porter's\r\ncomprehensive introduction and bibliography, as well as the time line of dates and events, make this a\r\nreference work that should be purchased by all public libraries. An online companion volume will be\r\npublished next year.\r\n-- Andrew Huff",

This includes things such as cutting energy use,\r\nincorporating more efficient production techniques, and finding cheaper methods of packaging and\r\nshipping goods.\r\nThe result is better not only for the environment, but also for company profits. Last year, MEP helped more than 1,000 firms save about $1.4 billion and increase their sales by $10.5 billion. These actions\r\nled to the creation of nearly 57,000 new jobs.\r\n\"It was tremendous for us,\" said Mark McCartney, general manager of the Clear Water bottled water\r\ncompany. \"MEP showed us how to cut our energy production in half, which led to a 3-percent increase\r\nin sales, and a 100-percent increase in production capacity.\"\r\nMcCartney has been quick to spread the wealth. Last year, a bottle of Clear Water retailed for $1.50.\r\nNow, MEP training has enabled the company to slash the price to $1.20.\r\nYour turn\r\nDear editor:\r\nI enjoyed the article on MEP in the June issue of Sustainability Magazine. When manufacturers pass\r\nsavings onto customers, everybody wins.\r\nOverall, the writer did a fine job. However, there is one mistake in the article I would like to point out.\r\nAfter our company finished training with MEP, sales jumped 30 percent, and our production capacity\r\nincreased by 10 percent.\r\nI would encourage every manufacturer to consider partnering with MEP. There's always some fat that\r\ncan be trimmed from the production process.\r\nWilliam Lyons\r\nCEO, Clear Water Bottling",

Wow, I never thought I'd be calling you that so soon. I'm glad that Cath\r\nhad a smooth delivery, and that Keegan is healthy. Thanks for sending his picture. He's a cute little guy.\r\nAnyway, we'll check the gift registries you mentioned, and I'll look forward to seeing Cath and Keegan\r\nshortly. Hope the open house goes well. I know it takes a lot to plan and host one.\r\nI'll e-mail Cathleen separately and say sorry and hi. Please give my love to Ken.\r\nSee you soon,\r\nRobin",

After interviewing with you and touring the facility, I feel strongly that this company\r\nwould be an ideal place for me to work.\r\nI now understand why Amarin, Ltd., is considered the premier publisher of travel and tourism books in\r\nthe region. I am impressed by the fact that it as been listed as one of Thailand's ten most successful\r\nbusinesses since it was founded six years ago. The company's reputation for quality is also reflected in\r\nits outstanding record of employee retention.\r\nI wanted to emphasize the fact that I attended a three-week intensive seminar on MarkTrends, the\r\nforemost marketing research software package. I know the job description mentions the ability to use\r\nMarkTrends, and I wanted to let you know that I am very comfortable using this software.\r\nAgain, thank you for your time and consideration.

We hope and pray that you will be able to join us for this momentous occasion.\r\nPlease RSVP by July 15th via letter or email to:\r\nGloria Stroust\r\nSuperior Catering\r\n120 Union Ave.\r\ngstroust@fmail.com\r\nJuly 11th, 2009\r\nDear Ms. Stroust,\r\nI am writing in regard to the invitation sent by Howard and Jennifer Jacobson. Please forgive my\r\nrelatively late reply, as I was out of town and did not have a chance to read the invitation until last\r\nweek.\r\nI am thrilled that my friend and former college roommate, Marilyn Strummers, is finally tying the knot.\r\nI am disappointed, however, that I will not be able to attend her milestone event. I had a vacation to\r\nChina scheduled for several weeks prior to hearing Marilyn's exciting news, and subsequent efforts to\r\nrearrange my travel plans have proved unsuccessful. Ironically, my flight departs at exactly the same\r\ntime as the ceremony. I'll miss Jeff and Marilyn at the airport by only a few hours!\r\nIt is with great regret that I must decline this gracious invitation, though I will contact Marilyn and\r\ncongratulate her personally before I leave. Also, I would like to leave a gift for the newlyweds. Would it\r\nbe appropriate to send a present to you?\r\nPlease let me know.\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatty Pakola\r\n4334 Stone Drive\r\n555-762-0091",

This includes a\r\ndonation of $2,300.00 made by robert Erwin, former trustee and president of the National Library\r\nOrganization, and must be spent by December 31.\r\nMs. Johnson suggested that the trustees spend the $2,300.00 as follows: $900.00 will be allocated for books;\r\n$400.00 for supplies; and $1,000.00 for building repairs. All members present agreed.\r\nBuilding Repairs and Improvements Mr. Elder expressed concern about the recent electricity bills, which were\r\nquite high. The issue will be discussed at the January 14 meeting after the year's budget has been reviewed.\r\nMiscellaneous Business Ms. Sprague noted that the library building should be kept locked when it is not\r\nofficially open to the public, even if staff or cleaning crews are present inside the building.\r\nMr. Elder ended the meeting at 7:00 p.m.\r\nThe next meeting will be on Thursday, December 18, at 5:00 p.m. in the Milton Public Library.",
