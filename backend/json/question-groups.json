This includes things such as cutting energy use,\r\nincorporating more efficient production techniques, and finding cheaper methods of packaging and\r\nshipping goods.\r\nThe result is better not only for the environment, but also for company profits. Last year, MEP helped more than 1,000 firms save about $1.4 billion and increase their sales by $10.5 billion. These actions\r\nled to the creation of nearly 57,000 new jobs.\r\n\"It was tremendous for us,\" said Mark McCartney, general manager of the Clear Water bottled water\r\ncompany. \"MEP showed us how to cut our energy production in half, which led to a 3-percent increase\r\nin sales, and a 100-percent increase in production capacity.\"\r\nMcCartney has been quick to spread the wealth. Last year, a bottle of Clear Water retailed for $1.50.\r\nNow, MEP training has enabled the company to slash the price to $1.20.\r\nYour turn\r\nDear editor:\r\nI enjoyed the article on MEP in the June issue of Sustainability Magazine. When manufacturers pass\r\nsavings onto customers, everybody wins.\r\nOverall, the writer did a fine job. However, there is one mistake in the article I would like to point out.\r\nAfter our company finished training with MEP, sales jumped 30 percent, and our production capacity\r\nincreased by 10 percent.\r\nI would encourage every manufacturer to consider partnering with MEP. There's always some fat that\r\ncan be trimmed from the production process.\r\nWilliam Lyons\r\nCEO, Clear Water Bottling"
