Re: Vacations
As of January 1st we will institute a new vacation policy. All employees who have been working for the
company two years or less will receive one week (five working days) of paid vacation per year. Employees who
have been working here three to five years will receive two weeks (ten working days) of paid vacation per year.
Employees who have been with the company five to ten years will receive three weeks (15 working days) of
paid vacation per year. Employees who have been here more than 10 years will receive four weeks (20 working
days) of paid vacation per year.
Please note that this does not effect current policies for sick days and personal leave. All employees, regardless
of experience, will still receive five days of paid sick leave per year, as well as two days of paid personal leave.
Please post the new vacation policy in your departments as soon as possible. Also, employee handbooks are
being revised to reflect the changes in vacation policy. These handbooks should be ready within the next two
weeks. When they are, you are responsible to distribute them to employees, and to send us verification that
each employee has received the handbook and understands the new vacation policy.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. If you have any questions, please contact me at extension 254 or

Rebecca Jean Porter, the author of Olympic Dreams, has attained another perfect score in this

from sporting events in ancient Rome to the origins of teams sports in North America, and it includes a
section on sports played on contemporary university campuses. I highly recommend the chapter with
detailed instructions on how to play games that had previously been lost over time. Porter's
comprehensive introduction and bibliography, as well as the time line of dates and events, make this a

Dear Ms. Baharn,
I'd like to thank you for the time you spent with me discussing the marketing researcher position at
Amarin, Ltd. After interviewing with you and touring the facility, I feel strongly that this company
would be an ideal place for me to work.
I now understand why Amarin, Ltd., is considered the premier publisher of travel and tourism books in
the region. I am impressed by the fact that it as been listed as one of Thailand's ten most successful
businesses since it was founded six years ago. The company's reputation for quality is also reflected in
its outstanding record of employee retention.
I wanted to emphasize the fact that I attended a three-week intensive seminar on MarkTrends, the
foremost marketing research software package. I know the job description mentions the ability to use
MarkTrends, and I wanted to let you know that I am very comfortable using this software.
Again, thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon concerning your hiring
decision.
Yours truly,

Manufacturers Going Green
By Leo Durham
An increasing number of manufacturing companies around the country are going green, which they
hope will put more green into their cash registers.
The Manufacturers Extension Partnership (MEP) works with a variety of state and regional industry
associations and economic development groups to teach companies ""lean"" manufacturing techniques.
This not-for-profit organization, administered by the Department of Commerce, demonstrates how to
reduce waste, or ""fat,"" in the manufacturing process. This includes things such as cutting energy use,
incorporating more efficient production techniques, and finding cheaper methods of packaging and
shipping goods.
The result is better not only for the environment, but also for company profits. Last year, MEP helped more than 1,000 firms save about $1.4 billion and increase their sales by $10.5 billion. These actions
led to the creation of nearly 57,000 new jobs.
""It was tremendous for us,"" said Mark McCartney, general manager of the Clear Water bottled water
company. ""MEP showed us how to cut our energy production in half, which led to a 3-percent increase
in sales, and a 100-percent increase in production capacity.""
McCartney has been quick to spread the wealth. Last year, a bottle of Clear Water retailed for $1.50.
Now, MEP training has enabled the company to slash the price to $1.20.
Your turn
Dear editor:
I enjoyed the article on MEP in the June issue of Sustainability Magazine. When manufacturers pass
savings onto customers, everybody wins.
Overall, the writer did a fine job. However, there is one mistake in the article I would like to point out.
After our company finished training with MEP, sales jumped 30 percent, and our production capacity
increased by 10 percent.
I would encourage every manufacturer to consider partnering with MEP. There's always some fat that
can be trimmed from the production process.

Hi Marc,
We received our Sept. order yesterday. Thank you for your usual prompt shipment. We appreciate the
fast turn-around.
Unfortunately, I noticed a couple of discrepancies between the freight and the invoice. First, the
discount for the white photocopier paper does not seem to be factored into the total. We have been
buying this paper from you at $100 a case, so shouldn't six cases with a 10-percent discount come to
$540?
Second, according to my records we had 10 crates of computer chairs on back order. Are more coming?
If so, what's the soonest you expect they could arrive? Also, could you please give me an idea when
more color ink cartridges will be available? Our inventory is low, and we are planning to have a special
sale for Halloween.
Could you please get back to me ASAP? I need to clarify these questions before I place our October
order. If you prefer to call, it's best to reach me today on my direct line: 556-424-8737.
Thanks again Marc,

Howard and Jennifer Jacobson request the honor of your presence on Aug. 10th to celebrate the joining
of their son, Jeffrey Parker Jacobson, and his fiancee, Marilyn Strummers, in holy matrimony.
The ceremony will take place at 11 a.m. in Riverside Park, 11220 River Dr. NW, followed by a luncheon
reception at the adjacent Green Mansion, then a procession to the airport to see the couple off to their
honeymoon in Bermuda.
Gifts are appreciated but not necessary; the fellowship of family and friends at this special time is
blessing enough. We hope and pray that you will be able to join us for this momentous occasion.
Please RSVP by July 15th via letter or email to:

Dear Ms. Stroust,
I am writing in regard to the invitation sent by Howard and Jennifer Jacobson. Please forgive my
relatively late reply, as I was out of town and did not have a chance to read the invitation until last
week.
I am thrilled that my friend and former college roommate, Marilyn Strummers, is finally tying the knot.
I am disappointed, however, that I will not be able to attend her milestone event. I had a vacation to
China scheduled for several weeks prior to hearing Marilyn's exciting news, and subsequent efforts to
rearrange my travel plans have proved unsuccessful. Ironically, my flight departs at exactly the same
time as the ceremony. I'll miss Jeff and Marilyn at the airport by only a few hours!
It is with great regret that I must decline this gracious invitation, though I will contact Marilyn and
congratulate her personally before I leave. Also, I would like to leave a gift for the newlyweds. Would it
be appropriate to send a present to you?
Please let me know.
Sincerely,
Patty Pakola

Hi Di,
I got your invitation today to the open house for Cathleen and Keegan. I'm so sorry that I have to miss it!
Brad and I are going skiing in Utah that weekend. We've been planning the trip for months, and it's too late
to change even though we wish we could. I'm dying to meet little Keegan! We'll be back on the ninth, and
I'd like to get together ASAP after that. Would that be OK?
You must be so proud, grandma! Wow, I never thought I'd be calling you that so soon. I'm glad that Cath
had a smooth delivery, and that Keegan is healthy. Thanks for sending his picture. He's a cute little guy.
Anyway, we'll check the gift registries you mentioned, and I'll look forward to seeing Cath and Keegan
shortly. Hope the open house goes well. I know it takes a lot to plan and host one.
I'll e-mail Cathleen separately and say sorry and hi. Please give my love to Ken.
See you soon,
Robin"
